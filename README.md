# Employee-Tracker

## Description

This project was to demonstrate to use mysql and node js. Using MySQL, and Inquirer, we are to create a database in which is has 3 tables; Employees, Roles, and Department. From there, we would make a database that will take user input to ask the user to select the department, role, salary of the role and employee. From there, the goal is to use mysql via the terminal to showcase the database, tables,and user input!

## Usage

First, I made a index.js to house and connect the npm packages we will be using inquirer and mysql 2 packages, From there, we download and added the proper node modules, package json, package-lock, and from there, we made two folders; db and lib. the db houses the connect, schema sql and seeds sql. From there, I coded the department, employee, and role. Unfortunatly, when I did the SORUCE schema.sql and seeds.sql, the database showed tables but empty values. I was unable to get the prompt to work in my SQL.
